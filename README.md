## Our Mission: 
    
    As outdoor enthusiasts we wanted to create a one stop platform to find your next camping spot!
    

## Our Process: 

   We found multiple API sources for campsites in our beautiful state including Colorado Parks and Rec, Recreation.gov, etc. We found the best API for our use
   case was Recreation.gov due to the satisfying layout of each individual campsite. It also allows us to narrow down sites to display whats available in every state,      availability, pet accomidation, amongst a slew of other options. This way we're able to display Colorado campsites for our page without having to go through the extra    sorting work.
   
   example of Recreation.gov API: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26885024/202314334-88da7893-f9b3-4860-9bc8-9f54ff80d9db.png)
   link to Recreation.gov: https://www.recreation.gov/search?inventory_type=camping
   
   
   
   The other API source we went for was Mapbox. We considered using other options such as Waze and Google Maps, but Mapbox will better suit our needs for the project      and is also the API used on the Recreation.gov website. Mapbox also gives us the freedom to style our map by changing fonts, colors, sizes, 3D features, and camera    angles.

## Our Result:

   In the past week our project has grown immensly! What started out as a camp site locator with a map is now an almost fully functional Campsite picker and               booker! After we got the map and campsite data functioning we jumped into different projects such as displaying weather on a seperate page and a date picker to
    reserve each individual campsite! You can now find a campsite you like, view weather data for the exact site coordinates, and book a reservation! We now have 3         API sources after including the weather API into our software! When it comes to booking a reservation, users are able to select dates for a specific campsite
    and their reservation is saved in the local storage but does not communicate with the recreation.gov website to actually reserve the specific campsite. You can
    view reservations that you have made on the homepage! Aside from the basic functionality of our API's, we have 2 small footers on our home page to learn a             litte bit more about us as a group and also contact us. On our Contact footer, each name has a function that opens up your mail app on your pc and autofills
    the chosen creators email to the draft!
