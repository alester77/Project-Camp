# Welcome to Project Camp!
Our Mission: 
    
    As outdoor enthusiasts we wanted to create a one stop platform to find your next camping spot!
    

Our Process: 

   We found multiple API sources for campsites in our beautiful state including Colorado Parks and Rec, Recreation.gov, etc. We found the best API for our use
   case was Recreation.gov due to the satisfying layout of each individual campsite. The other API source we went for was Google Maps, although Waze is easier to            integrate, we found that the tools that Google Maps provides would better suit our needs for this project. 
   
   example of Recreation.gov API: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26885024/202314334-88da7893-f9b3-4860-9bc8-9f54ff80d9db.png)
