Our Mission: 
    
    As outdoor enthusiasts we wanted to create a one stop platform to find your next camping spot!
    

Our Process: 

   We found multiple API sources for campsites in our beautiful state including Colorado Parks and Rec, Recreation.gov, etc. We found the best API for our use
   case was Recreation.gov due to the satisfying layout of each individual campsite. It also allows us to narrow down sites to display whats available in every state,      availability, pet accomidation, amongst a slew of other options. This way we're able to display Colorado campsites for our page without having to go through the extra    sorting work.

   The other API source we went for was Mapbox. We considered using other options such as Waze and Google Maps, but Mapbox will better suit our needs for the project and    is also the API used on the Recreation.gov website. Mapbox also gives us the freedom to style our map by changing fonts, colors, sizes, 3D features, and camera          angles.
